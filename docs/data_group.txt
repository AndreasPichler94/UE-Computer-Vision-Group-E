# Generate the dataset for training

1. Generate cleaned dataset
	- 95% of original samples go into "train" dataset
	- remaining 5% end up in "test" dataset

2. Add the AOS integral to the cleaned data for train & test


# Set up training utils

Jakob:

3. Write a PyTorch data loader for the cleaned data


Jaroslav:

4. Write a method that allows the evaluation of a model (track test loss, image quality metric)

	- need a test loader, and a model


Jakob: 

5. Checkpointing system to easily back up / load models locally
