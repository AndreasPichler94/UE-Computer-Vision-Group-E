Deliverables:


- custom data loader
	- load out of cloud or locally? (hybrid?)

- training loop with performance evaluation
	- track train/test loss

- checkpointing system with cloud backups
	- Google Drive or just github?

- hyperparameter training framework (grid search?)

- baby network for testing purposes

- U-Net, Vision Transf., Deeplab



Strategies:

- Code should also run offline on our PCs

- Program to an interface
	- networks should easily be swapped out with no code changes required
	- same goes for loss functions

- Code should default to CUDA, but fallback to CPU

- Keep it organized
	- split up code across files

- Use version control (github)
